## Current schedule

These are the currently-booked training sessions:

```{r}
source(here::here("R/training_sessions.R"))

training_sessions(dt_output = TRUE) 
```

## Training menu

These are all the stand-alone training sessions currently on offer. Please get in touch if you'd like to see something additional:

```{r}
readr::read_csv(here::here("data/KIND_training_sessions.csv")) |>
  DT::datatable(filter = "top")

```

```{r include=FALSE}
# an awful kludge - need to run the training sessions again silently to ensure that all ics get added to the www, even if we don't have suitable main training for that type. Tableau was a nice example.
