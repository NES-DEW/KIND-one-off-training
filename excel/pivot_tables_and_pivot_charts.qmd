## Welcome!

+ this session is for üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èintermediate Excel users
+ we'll do an initial chat and run through, followed by a practical demo
    + you're welcome to stay for all or part of the session
+ if you want to follow the practical part, you'll need:
    + Excel, ideally M365 Desktop
    + previous Excel experience (particularly around references, tables, and formulas)
    + the data: [guidance](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/nhs-waiting-times-18-weeks-referral-to-treatment/nhs-waiting-times-18-weeks-referral-to-treatment-quarter-ending-31-december-2023/) / [download page](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/18-weeks-referral-to-treatment) / [direct](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/aa8b22e8-8a02-484d-a6c8-0a0154a6249d/resource/f2598c24-bf00-4171-b7ef-a469bbacbf6c/download/open_data_18_weeks_rtt.csv) / short **tinyurl.com/kinddata1**
+ it also helps if you have access to the chat. You may need to add youself to the KIND Network Teams channel: **tinyurl.com/kindnetwork**


## Session outline

+ Pivot tables
+ Pivot charts
+ Slicers
+ the session is totally informal
  + cameras on, please
  + chat/question away
  + don't panic if things go wrong

## Why pivot tables?

-   **the** key summary tool in Excel
-   we often want to summarise long/complex data
-   two key concerns:
    -   we want to do that safely
    -   we also want to do that effectively
-   pivot tables are safe and effective
    -   they keep your analysis out of your data
    -   they have lots of powerful tools built-in

## Some data

1.  on the [18 week referral target](https://opendata.scot/datasets/public+health+scotland-18+weeks+referral+to+treatment/)
2.  Copy the [data link](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/aa8b22e8-8a02-484d-a6c8-0a0154a6249d/resource/f2598c24-bf00-4171-b7ef-a469bbacbf6c/download/open_data_18_weeks_rtt.csv)
3.  Open the **Get Data From web** tool </br> ![](images/clipboard-1578174090.png)
4.  Paste in the link </br> ![](images/clipboard-1582667377.png)

## What questions might we ask about that data?

## Insert a pivot table

-   on a new sheet</br> ![](images/clipboard-1899219137.png)
-   `ALT`, `N`, `V`, `T`

## Adding data to a pivot table

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/pt_cols.png){height="500"}
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
<!-- empty column to create gap -->
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}
-   we build pivot tables from the fields interface

## Improving our pivot table

![](images/clipboard-1128103846.png){height="300"}

-   that gives us a simple pivot table
-   we can also add a PivotChart instantly - click on your pivot table, and press `Alt + F1`
    -   play with the expansion buttons - the PivotChart should update to reflect the way that your PivotTable is currently arranged

## PivotTable warnings

-   this isn't Excel!
-   warnings about coherence

## PivotTable tips

::: callout-note
-   Double-click any cell in a PivotTable to see the underlying data
-   Group PivotTable items using:
    -   `Shift` + `Alt` + `‚Üí` (right arrow) to add items to a group
    -   `Shift` + `Alt` + `‚Üê` (left arrow) to ungroup
-   Add a new calculated field using `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `=` (equals)
-   Delete an entire PivotTable using `Ctrl + A` then pressing `Del`

## Add board names

-   those codes are hard work
-   let's make them [look a little more human](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/geography-codes-and-labels/resource/652ff726-e676-4a20-abda-435b98dd7bdc)
-   [board names data](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/datastore/dump/652ff726-e676-4a20-abda-435b98dd7bdc?bom=True)

## Years and months

-   our Month column is a pain
-   we can turn that back into a proper date
-   `=date(left([@Month], 4), right([@Month], 2), 24)`
-   refresh the pivot table, and update the fields

## PivotTable pages

-   we can split out parts of a PivotTable to separate worksheets

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  Drag the Years item to the *Filters* field. This should update the PivotTable so that only one year's data is present at once
2.  We can also split each year into its own worksheet: find the option in the PivotTable Analyze section of the ribbon - or via `Alt`, `J`, `T`, `T`, `P` </br>![](images/05_jttp.png)
:::

## Slicing

-   one slicer can control many PivotTables

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  Click within one of your new annual PivotTables
2.  Add a slicer from the insert menu (or `ALT`, `N`, `S`, `F`)
3.  Select date to slice on
4.  When the slicer appears, right click and select "Report Connections..." and add the other annual PivotTables
5.  Now select a couple of months from your slicer, and see the effect on your PivotTables
:::

-   if you're working with dates, you can also use the timeline, which works in exactly the same way. Insert with `ALT`, `N`, `S`, `T`, update the connections, and you can get fine-grained control over which date-ranges contribute to your PivotTable
