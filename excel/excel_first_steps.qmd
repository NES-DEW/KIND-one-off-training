- [slides](src/excel_first_steps_sl.html) / [pdf slides](src/excel_first_steps_sl.pdf) for this session

## Welcome!

-   this session is ðŸŒ¶: a beginner-level introduction
-   you're very welcome to just watch, but if you want to follow along, you'll need Excel of some sort
    -   totally informal and chatty, so cameras on etc etc
-   also want to plug [the M365 Skills Hub for NHSS folks](https://scottish.sharepoint.com/sites/NHSSLearningPathways)

## Session outline

![](images/mermaid-diagram-2024-06-20-124115.png){width="100%"}

## A brief overview of Excel

![](images/clipboard-965547330.png){width="60%"}

-   one of the oldest, and most widely used, pieces of desktop software
-   ubiquitous in business, finance, health and social care...
-   proprietary, closed-source, paid-for
-   many versions

## Central idea

-   pieces of data are stored in cells
    -   one value, one cell
-   cells are arranged into rows and columns</br> ![](images/clipboard-1879510795.png){width="60%"}
-   arranging data like this allows us to analyse it
-   good data analysis helps make services better

## Data should help...

-   answering which/when questions
-   seeing effects of changes
-   comparing different areas
-   looking at services over time
-   ...

## One word of warning before the practical part

-   there are lots of versions of Excel
-   they all work slightly differently
-   please don't panic if what you see looks slightly different from what I'm showing you
-   please ask if you're not happy/confident!

## Opening Excel (desktop)

## Interface

## Save, close, open

![](images/clipboard-3187630465.png){height="40%"} ![](images/clipboard-1979369937.png){height="40%"}

-   save your new workbook
-   close it
-   re-open it (possibly from recent files)

## References

-   every cell in Excel has a **reference** - like its address
-   references look like this: `E7` <br> ![](images/cols.png)
    -   `E` refers to a vertical column
    -   `7` to a horizontal row

## Data entry

-   let's add some data...
-   we can type into the cells </br> ![](images/clipboard-1771455666.png)
-   that data appears in the formula bar too

## An example: school holidays

-   https://www.scotborders.gov.uk/schools-learning/term-holiday-closure-dates/2
-   make three headings in row 1: `name`, `start_date`, `end_date` </br> ![](images/clipboard-1395187747.png)

## Values

-   let's add some values from the school holidays webpage
-   name of holiday
-   start date
-   end date
    -   dates usually go `DD/MM/YYYY` - as we'll see, Excel does lots of helping when we enter dates...
    -   ...ðŸ˜±
-   we'll only need a few rows of data

::: notes
name start_date end_date Mid-term holidays 14/10/2024 18/10/2024 In service day 21/10/2024 21/10/2024 St Andrew's Day 02/12/2024 02/12/2024

## Tidy data

-   keep things consistent - spelling, case, formats, etc
    -   one piece of data per cell
    -   one instance per row (one school holiday per row)
    -   one variable per column (a column of names, one of start dates...)

## Tables

-   we can convert this group of cells into a proper **table**
-   click in one of your cells of data </br> ![](images/clipboard-1117112977.png)
-   `Insert` \> `Table` (or `Ctrl` + `T`) </br> ![](images/clipboard-166790706.png)
-   click `OK`</br>![](images/clipboard-77557231.png)

## Lots of new things to see

![](images/clipboard-1614882971.png)

## Autofill

-   we'll add a formula to calculate how long our holidays are
-   add a new column called `days`
-   paste `= 1 + (C2 - B2)` into the first cell of that new column
    -   and look out for our session on formulas...
-   double-click the green fill handle to fill the rest of the column </br> ![](images/clipboard-1731283483.png)

## Formatting

-   we can change the way that our spreadsheet looks
-   we can also change the way our values look

## Cell formatting

-   some examples </br> ![](images/clipboard-4175540765.png)
    -   highlighting
    -   bold
    -   borders

## Number formatting

-   our dates are **number formatted**
-   Excel dates are actually numbers (like `45583`) formatted to look like dates
-   1900 dates!
-   percentages, Â£, ...

## Conditional formatting

- we can also format based on values </br> ![](images/clipboard-3358194074.png)
- take care though - this can be both ugly, and inaccessible
