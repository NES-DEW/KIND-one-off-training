## Welcome

-   this session is [ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶]{style="color:red;"}, so it's designed for intermediate users with plenty of previous Excel PivotTable experience
    -   [PowerPivot infrastructure varies widely](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/where-is-power-pivot-aa64e217-4b6e-410b-8337-20b87e1c2a4b), so we can't advise on installation
-   if you can't access the chat, you might need to join our Teams channel: **tinyurl.com/kindnetwork**

## Session outline

-   check that you have Power Pivot please!
-   find and tidy some data
-   add to Power Pivot
-   play with data in Power Pivot

## Word of warning

-   Power Pivot in Excel is still officially supported, but has been largely replaced by Power BI
    -   I'd be circumspect about its long-term prospects
    -   I'd also be cautious about starting more ambitious projects in Power Pivot - lots of glitches, few fixes

## Nutshell

-   PowerPivot = effectively a [local SSAS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/ssas-overview?view=asallproducts-allversions)
-   that means PowerPivot allows you to do fancy relational work with your data
-   it *can* also means higher performance with large (10k rows +) data
-   yet allows you to use Excel for data ingest and output

## Data

-   download the [Agatha Christie dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A8ZRe5KLLAllhT31pCzke4j5qAPqeMKf0jYgyJXcoPs/edit#gid=564606948) as an Excel file
-   tidying:
    -   remove filters
    -   create 4 x named tables
    -   standardising titles if you're highly conscientious

## Add data to Power Pivot

-   find Power Pivot
-   add to data model x 4
-   diagram view and create relationships

## DAX intro

-   similar to, but larger, than Excel formula language
-   structured references - so `table[column]`
-   no referencing individual cells/random ranges
-   ability to write expressions that update in Pivot Tables

## Make a Pivot Table

-   this should feel nice and familiar - with the option of bringing together several tables of data</br> ![](images/clipboard-3398167195.png){height="300px"}![](images/clipboard-1733713359.png){height="300px"}

## Make a new column

-   `= all_titles[Year of first publication] - 1`
-   rename, return to your Pivot table, and ruin the years...

## Relationships

-   you can create relationships between different parts of your data, and exploit those relationships using DAX
-   open the diagram view, and connect the `Title ID` columns together</br>![](images/clipboard-4256752901.png){height="400px"}

## Relationships have directions

## Fancier calculated column
(with thanks to Michael Roarty, NHS NSS)

-   add a series col to your all_titles data
    -   `=related(novels[Series]) & related(short_stories[Series])`
-   add a year of publication col to your short_story data
    -   `=LOOKUPVALUE(ssc[Year of first publication], ssc[Title Name], short_stories[Collection])`
-   add a rounded year
    -   `= MROUND([Year of first publication], 5)`
