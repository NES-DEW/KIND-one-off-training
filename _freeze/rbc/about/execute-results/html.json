I find it great as a beginner to bring things that confuse me into the open and get some experienced users' teachings, tips and tricks!\n- They're very informative and honest in that Brendan will specify scenarios of best use and any limitations.  I find some of the sessions a bit rushed but I think that might be more about my ability and comprehension.\n- I wondered if people who are completely new to R might have been a bit daunted by the speed at which we went through things? I really like the approach of asking people about the actual issues they're facing though. I'm going to be aware of what I get stuck on to bring to future sessions. I'm really excited about this new club!\n  \n:::  \n\n\n## About\n\nWe run a monthly R beginner's club on Teams. If youâ€™re new to R, please consider yourself invited to come along for mutual support, troubleshooting, and tips for building your R skills and confidence.\n\nFull details and joining instructions via the [KIND network Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3AQZ7-PbFVcziG2piHLt1_ifey3I2cwFL0yBuTSS8vVao1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=106d08f3-9026-40e2-b3c7-87cd87304d58&tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a).",
