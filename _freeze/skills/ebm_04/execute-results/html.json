Please review the abstract of @smith2003 available at [bmj.com](https://www.bmj.com/content/327/7429/1459.short). What point is the author trying to make?\n1. Please now review the abstract of @yeh2018 available at [bmj.com](https://www.bmj.com/content/363/bmj.k5094). What point are the authors trying to make?\n\n:::\n\n## Finding out if treatments work is hard\n\n+ most examples are not like the parachute case [@xu2022]\n+ most treatment effects are subtle\n+ statistics are a vital way of being more sure about the results we get\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n+ the [Number Needed to Treat](https://www.cebm.ox.ac.uk/resources/ebm-tools/number-needed-to-treat-nnt) is the number of patients that need to be treated to prevent an undesirable outcome\n:::\n\n+ NNTs are [often startlingly high](https://thennt.com/nnt/nicotine-replacement-therapy-for-smoking-cessation/)\n\n\n\n# Sample size (n)\n\n## Introduction\n\n+ as treatment effects are subtle, we often need to use large groups of participants\n    + as we'll see, there are concerns about margins of error that explain this - later!\n+ trials have grown:\n    + MRC streptomycin study, 1948, 109 participants [@streptom1948]\n    + WOSCOPS, 1995, 6595 participants [@shepherd1995]\n    + TRITON, 2009, 3534 participants [@montalescot2009]\n    + RE-LY, 2010, 18113 participants [@wallentin2010]\n+ see also worries about the logic of large trials in medicine [@penston2005] and elsewhere [@lortie-forgues2019] - \"often uninformative\"\n\n## The problem of growing sample sizes\n\n+ recruitment is hard\n+ larger n = harder recruitment\n    + may end up relying on heterogeneous population\n      + e.g. @montalescot2009\n      + 3534 participants\n      + 707 sites\n      + 30 countries\n    \n## Confidence intervals\n\n+ or, why make things so large?\n+ intuition: the larger our sample, the more precise our estimates\n\n\n\n\n## Confidence intervals\n\n+ imagine we're evaluating an intervention in a small population\n+ 10% of the treatment arm get some outcome, compared to 12% in the control arm\n+ relative risk in this trial population = 83%\n+ **Q**: what will the relative risk be in the whole population?\n\n## The idea of sampling error\n+ our measure of risk in our small population sample might not accurately reflect the true population risk\n    + AKA standard error\n+ we can't say exactly how accurate our sample estimate is\n    + unless we know the true population risk \n+ but we can give an interval estimate for our measurement, effectively describing likely lower and upper values within which the estimate might lie\n\n## Confidence intervals\n\n+ for our example with 83% relative risk, our confidence interval might be between 75% and 91%\n  + we could say \"the chances are that our 'real' population risk would be between 75% and 91%\" \n+ we conventionally use 95% confidence for these kinds of EBM estimates of confidence\n  + effectively, saying that there's a 95% chance the 'true' population risk is contained within this interval\n  + you might see these expressed as 95% CIs in print\n+ @sedgwick2014 is a good next-step reading on CIs\n\n\n## E2: ways to cheat\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Task\"}\n\n1. Take Greenhalgh's list of ways to cheat</br>![Greenhalgh's ways to cheat](images/04_ways_to_cheat.png){height=300}\n1. Are there any areas where your paper from the previous session might be faulty in this way?\n\n:::\n\n\n# p-values\n\n## Introduction\n+ imagine that you're looking at a 95% CI that is reported as follows:\n    + \"the relative risk of death in the intervention group compared to the control group was 92% (95% CI 72-112%)\"\n      + what does this result mean to you?\n      + is there a real reduction of death in the intervention group?\n+ that wide confidence interval means the population risk might well be 100% - the control group might not prevent death at all\n+ what does this mean for us?\n\n## two kinds of statistical work\n1. descriptive statistics = what do these numbers look like\n2. inferential statistics = what do these numbers tell us\n\n## hypothesis testing\n+ technically, RCT reports are **hypothesis tests**\n+ hypothesis = educated guess about outcomes\n+ hypothesis testing is definitely part of inferential statistics\n+ hypothesis vs null hypothesis\n    + what we think will happen if the treatment works\n    + what we think will happen if the treatment does not work\n\n## does the data support the hypothesis?\n+ does the evidence (our sample data) support the hypothesis, or the null hypothesis?\n+ we could use a two-tailed statistical test to compare the support for each\n+ these tests give us a P-value, which is:\n\n> ...the probability of obtaining the observed difference between treatment groups...if there was no difference between treatment groups [@sedgwick2014a]\n\n## P-values tell us about support\n\n+ assume the null hypothesis is true\n    + that our treatment does nothing\n+ the P-value tells us how often we'd expect to get results like our real results just by chance\n+ P-values are probabilities, so reported as a number between 0 and 1\n+ **critical level of significance** = the arbitrary level below which P-values are assumed to be convincing\n    + usually P = 0.05 - below that, the results are said to be statistically significant\n+ P-values tell us whether our data supports our hypothesis (when P < 0.05) or whether it supports the null hypothesis (when P is > 0.05)\n\n# effect sizes\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n- an important third statistical tool deals with effect sizes\n- so far, we've just looked at individual trial results\n- from now on, though, we're going to look at pooled results\n- we'll need a way of comparing outcomes between trials\n\n## Cohen's d\n\n- informally, calculated by taking the difference between (control and treatment) groups, and dividing by the standard deviation\n    - because we're being non-technical in this session, we can think of the SD as a measure of variation or spread\n     - usually positive (absolute value reported)\n- that means that d expresses the effect size in terms of the natural variation within the study population\n    - try playing with the demonstration on [rpsychologist.com](https://rpsychologist.com/cohend/)\n- anything over 1 is massive (a whole standard deviation difference), anything under 0.2 is tiny\n- the third reference to @sedgwick2015 - really recommend that sequence of articles for the technical questions about EBM\n\n\n## E3: putting it all together\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Task\"}\n\n+ here's a timely reference: [@effecto2020]?\n+ what do you think here about the:\n    + sample size\n    + the duration and completeness of follow-up\n    + the use of confidence intervals\n    + the use of p-values\n    + any discussion of effect sizes\n:::\n\n\n## References",
