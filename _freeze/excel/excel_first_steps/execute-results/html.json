  totally informal and chatty, so cameras on etc etc\n-   also want to plug [the M365 Skills Hub for NHSS folks](https://scottish.sharepoint.com/sites/NHSSLearningPathways)\n\n## Session outline\n\n![](images/mermaid-diagram-2024-06-20-124115.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n## A brief overview of Excel\n\n![](images/clipboard-965547330.png){width=\"60%\"}\n\n-   one of the oldest, and most widely used, pieces of desktop software\n-   ubiquitous in business, finance, health and social care...\n-   proprietary, closed-source, paid-for\n-   many versions\n\n## Central idea\n\n-   pieces of data are stored in cells\n    -   one value, one cell\n-   cells are arranged into rows and columns</br> ![](images/clipboard-1879510795.png){width=\"60%\"}\n-   arranging data like this allows us to analyse it\n-   good data analysis helps make services better\n\n## Data should help...\n\n-   answering which/when questions\n-   seeing effects of changes\n-   comparing different areas\n-   looking at services over time\n-   ...\n\n## One word of warning before the practical part\n\n-   there are lots of versions of Excel\n-   they all work slightly differently\n-   please don't panic if what you see looks slightly different from what I'm showing you\n-   please ask if you're not happy/confident!\n\n## Opening Excel (desktop)\n\n![](images/clipboard-1394052793.png) ![](images/clipboard-2150015829.png)\n\n## Opening Excel (web)\n\n![](images/clipboard-3067626588.png)\n\n## Interface\n\n![](images/interface.png){width=\"90%\"}\n\n## Save, close, open\n\n![](images/clipboard-3187630465.png){height=\"40%\"} ![](images/clipboard-1979369937.png){height=\"40%\"}\n\n-   save your new workbook\n-   close it\n-   re-open it (possibly from recent files)\n\n## References\n\n-   every cell in Excel has a **reference** - like its address\n-   references look like this: `E7` <br> ![](images/cols.png)\n    -   `E` refers to a vertical column\n    -   `7` to a horizontal row\n\n## Data entry\n\n-   let's add some data...\n-   we can type into the cells </br> ![](images/clipboard-1771455666.png)\n-   that data appears in the formula bar too\n\n## An example: school holidays\n\n-   https://www.scotborders.gov.uk/schools-learning/term-holiday-closure-dates/2\n-   make three headings in row 1: `name`, `start_date`, `end_date` </br> ![](images/clipboard-1395187747.png)\n\n## Values\n\n-   let's add some values from the school holidays webpage\n-   name of holiday\n-   start date\n-   end date\n    -   dates usually go `DD/MM/YYYY` - as we'll see, Excel does lots of helping when we enter dates...\n    -   ...ðŸ˜±\n-   we'll only need a few rows of data\n\n::: notes\nname start_date end_date Mid-term holidays 14/10/2024 18/10/2024 In service day 21/10/2024 21/10/2024 St Andrew's Day 02/12/2024 02/12/2024\n:::\n\n## Tidy data\n\n-   keep things consistent - spelling, case, formats, etc\n    -   one piece of data per cell\n    -   one instance per row (one school holiday per row)\n    -   one variable per column (a column of names, one of start dates...)\n\n## Tables\n\n-   we can convert this group of cells into a proper **table**\n-   click in one of your cells of data </br> ![](images/clipboard-1117112977.png)\n-   `Insert` \\> `Table` (or `Ctrl` + `T`) </br> ![](images/clipboard-166790706.png)\n-   click `OK`</br>![](images/clipboard-77557231.png)\n\n## Lots of new things to see\n\n![](images/clipboard-1614882971.png)\n\n## Autofill\n\n-   we'll add a formula to calculate how long our holidays are\n-   add a new column called `days`\n-   paste `= 1 + (C2 - B2)` into the first cell of that new column\n    -   and look out for our session on formulas...\n-   double-click the green fill handle to fill the rest of the column </br> ![](images/clipboard-1731283483.png)\n\n## Formatting\n\n-   we can change the way that our spreadsheet looks\n-   we can also change the way our values look\n\n## Cell formatting\n\n-   some examples </br> ![](images/clipboard-4175540765.png)\n    -   highlighting\n    -   bold\n    -   borders\n\n## Number formatting\n\n-   our dates are **number formatted**\n-   Excel dates are actually numbers (like `45583`) formatted to look like dates\n-   1900 dates!\n-   percentages, Â£, ...\n\n## Conditional formatting\n\n- we can also format based on values </br> ![](images/clipboard-3358194074.png)\n- take care though - this can be both ugly, and inaccessible\n",
