Off to change all my excel sheets to tables :)\n- Tables came in after I'd learnt Excel & I'd used them occasionally but not fully understood & utilised. Now feel confident to make tables at the start of any Excel work.\n  \n:::  \n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=false appearance='default' icon=true}\n\n## Session materials\n+ [all materials {{< iconify ph:file-zip size=2x >}}](src/excel_tables.zip)\n+ slides [{{< iconify ph:file-html size=2x >}} html](src/excel_tables.html) / [{{< iconify ph:file-pdf size=2x >}} pdf](src/excel_tables.pdf)\n:::\n\n\n## Welcome\n\n-   this session is ðŸŒ¶: for Excel beginners\n-   you can find session materials at **tinyurl.com/kindtrp**\n\n\n\n## Where does this fit in?\n\n![KIND Excel beginner skill tree](images/clipboard-3911010684.png)\n\n-   for this session, you'll need to be familiar with the Excel basics (getting around in Excel, opening/saving/closing files, A1 referencing, and values)\n-   we're going to dodge formatting and formulas as much as possible today\n\n## Session outline\n\n-   introduction\n-   add and remove tables\n-   grow and shrink tables\n-   autofill and friends\n-   sort and filter\n-   names and reference\n-   pass data to other tools\n\n## Introduction\n\n-   this is an easy session to sum up: **use tables in Excel**\n-   most people don't use Excel tables\n-   they're probably the best Excel skill investment there is\n-   this is a practical session, so you'll need some kind of Excel to follow along\n\n## Some data\n\n-   tables are potentially useful throughout the life-cycle of an Excel file\n-   let's start at the beginning:\n    1.  open Excel\n    2.  in a new worksheet, please enter today's date\n        1.  DD/MM/YYYY format is best, but we'll park that for the formatting session </br> ![Enter a date in a cell](images/clipboard-3905090772.png)\n\n## Add a table\n\n1. make sure you have that date selected\n1.  In the ribbon menu, go to `Insert` `>` `Table` </br> ![`Insert` `>` `Table`](images/clipboard-112703173.png)\n    1.  or you can use `Ctrl` + `t`\n2.  you'll be asked to create a table - you should be able just to select `OK` </br> ![Create a table](images/clipboard-3913166740.png)\n\n## A first table\n\n-   congratulations, you should now have a 1-cell table on your worksheet </br>![a 1-cell table](images/clipboard-467996436.png)\n-   think about this as a **container** for your data\n    -   you could call it a **data structure** instead if you wanted to be more fancy\n\n## Removing your table\n\n1.  Tables aren't formatting - so you can't clear them like formatting\n2.  Click inside your table, and you should see a new section of the ribbon menu - `Design` or `Table Design` depending on your version </br>![`Design` or `Table Design` menu](images/clipboard-903977516.png)\n3.  Select that `Table Design` section. The most useful parts are on the far left: </br> ![`Design` or `Table Design` menu](images/clipboard-1056500409.png)\n4.  Select `Convert to Range` - your table should now return to being an ordinary cell\n5.  Finally, please **re-table** your cell\n\n## Grow and shrink tables\n\nLet's add some new data:\n\n1.  Please add three or four more dates, going back into last week, in the rows below your date\n2.  Please add a word describing your main breakfast item in the next column\n3.  Please add a third column, scoring that breakfast out of ten\n\n## Grow and shrink tables\n4. Now expand your table to include that new data. You can drag the blue handle </br>![Expand your table with the blue handle](images/clipboard-2487072995.png) or use the `Resize Table` tool in the ribbon menu </br> ![`Resize Table` tool in the ribbon menu](images/clipboard-1207705760.png). \n1. You can use the same methods to shrink a table\n\n## Autofill and friends\n\n1.  drag down to add two more empty rows\n1.  select your three dates, and drag the **green** fill handle down into the empty cells </br>![drag the **green** fill handle down into the empty cells](images/clipboard-3445425412.png)\n1.  this *should* populate the correct values - although you'll need to check carefully that everything has worked\n\n## Filter and sort\n\nEach of your column headers has a dropdown menu ![dropdown menu](images/clipboard-1297021923.png) that will allow you to sort and filter your table\n\n- sort allows you to order your table by that column\n- filters shows and hides rows of the table\n- you'll have different filtering options for the different types of columns in your table\n\n## Names and reference\n\n- you can name each column. These work best as single descriptive words - `date` rather than `breakfast date`\n\n    -   you might find it helpful to write longer names in snake case (`breakfast_date`) or camel case (`breakfastDate`)\n\n    -   please now name your columns\n\n-   you can also name the table as a whole. Again, that's done from the left-hand side of the `Table` menu </br> ![name tables from the left-hand side of the `Table` menu](images/clipboard-3100742867.png)\n\n    -   please give your table an appropriate name\n\n## Passing data demo\n\n-   Your table can now be saved, developed further, or passed to other data tools\n-   Tables have major advantages on this front:\n    -   they're portable, so you can move a table around\n    -   you can use **structured referencing** - like `=data[score]` - to select an entire column by name, which helps make Excel more robust\n        -   see the intermediate Excel session on referencing\n    -   you can send the data easily and safely to PivotTables, PowerQuery, PowerPivot, and other fancier data tools\n\n## CONCLUSION: USE TABLES {.center}\n",
