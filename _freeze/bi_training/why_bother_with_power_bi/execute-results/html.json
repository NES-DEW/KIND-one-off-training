A novice might not have understood what the advantages of BI were over Excel or Powerpoint. I think the comment re licences was very relevant as was the one re Power BI is easier to get started with than say R however the more complicated the requirement R etc. may be a better long term bet.  I'd like to have heard the pros and cons of BI versus Microstrategy or Tableau etc.  Microstrategy is widely used across the NHS but would we be better to \"upgrade\" to BI?  That's a question I don't know the answer to but is very relevant to myself and my team.  Overall it was a good session.\n- I was blown away at the map example and had not seen anything like this before\n- Great to have a short session that provided a quick insight into using Power BI including a relevant worked example.\n  \n:::  \n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Welcome\n\n-   welcome to **Why bother with Power BI?**\n-   this session is ðŸ¥¬ - a non-technical introduction for pre-beginners\n-   if you can't access the chat, you might need to join our Teams channel: **tinyurl.com/kindnetwork**\n\n## The KIND network\n\n-   a social learning space for staff working with **k**nowledge, **i**nformation, and **d**ata across health, social care, and housing in Scotland\n-   we offer social support, free training, mentoring, community events, ...\n-   [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3AQZ7-PbFVcziG2piHLt1_ifey3I2cwFL0yBuTSS8vVao1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=106d08f3-9026-40e2-b3c7-87cd87304d58&tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a) / [mailing list](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=veDvEDCgykuAnLXmdF5JmpopIZB9ynRJnrPUHVFccipURjM2NkZJUkhGOFlQRjQxRFhVUTgwT0UwVyQlQCN0PWcu)\n\n## Session outline\n\n-   two minute overview of Power BI\n-   strengths and weaknesses\n-   making Power BI work for you\n-   next steps and training\n\n## A brief overview of Power BI\n\n-   new\n-   integrates several existing Microsoft products (bits of Excel, PowerPivot, PowerQuery...)\n-   produces interactive dashboards\n-   proprietary, closed-source, paid-for\n\n## Central idea\n\n-   data is complicated\n-   good data analysis helps make services better\n-   but predicting what data users will need is hard\n\n## Why are users so fussy about their data?\n\n-   data can be used to answer lots of different kinds of questions\n    -   answering which/when questions\n    -   seeing effects of changes\n    -   comparing different areas\n    -   looking at services over time\n    -   ...\n\n## Power BI\n\n-   lets users re-arrange their data to suit (interactive)\n-   provides a standard way of accessing data from lots of sources ([data hub](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODMwNjRjMGMtZDhhZC00ZjQzLTgzYWItZTA3ZWM0ZDcyOGY2IiwidCI6IjUwZjYwNzFmLWJiZmUtNDAxYS04ODAzLTY3Mzc0OGU2MjllMiIsImMiOjh9))\n-   scales really well ([dashboard example](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODJjOGE3ZDUtM2ViNy00YjBlLTllMjktOTNjZjlkODJhODU4IiwidCI6ImU3YTEzYWVhLTk0MzctNGRiNy1hMjJiLWNmYWE0Y2UzM2I2ZSJ9))\n\n## Power BI demo\n\n### take [a spreadsheet](data/gp_pract.xlsx) and load that data </br>\n![](images/clipboard-1773606480.png) \n\n### preview the data </br>\n![](images/clipboard-3750020719.png)\n\n### work with the data in Power BI </br> \n![](images/clipboard-887422480.png)\n\n### tidy/wrangle the data in Power Query </br> \n![](images/clipboard-2135432491.png)\n### add a map visual </br> \n![](images/clipboard-4289264945.png)\n\n### populate with our data </br> \n![](images/clipboard-4285049290.png)\n\n### add a column graph </br> \n![](images/clipboard-4221248636.png)\n\n### populate with drag and drop </br> \n![](images/clipboard-1883827365.png)\n\n### add slicer </br> \n![](images/clipboard-1767130583.png) \n\n### slicers change our visualisations </br> \n![](images/clipboard-2628441850.png)\n\n### add a numeric summary </br> \n![](images/clipboard-3093070697.png)\n\n### publish\nSee [preview](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/3fef0f33-7d64-47b8-9e1c-ae0129db6720/ReportSection?experience=power-bi) - although note that access might require permission\n\n## Five top tips\n\n- potentially has the power to get lots of new good out of existing data\n- Power BI needs tidy input data - so use Excel tables etc\n- don't believe the no-code lies - you'll need some [DAX](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/) and [Power Query M](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/)\n- [publishing is complicated and potentially expensive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/pricing), so needs investigating before building a product\n- complex IG picture across Scotland, so please get official guidance early\n\n## Chat, queries, questions\n\n-   Teams channel: **tinyurl.com/kindnetwork**\n-   weekly email update: **tinyurl.com/kindupdate**\n-   Training mini-site: **tinyurl.com/kindtrain**\n",
