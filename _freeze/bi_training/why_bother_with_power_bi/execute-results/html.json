I don't have any experience with coding and think Power BI could be quite useful for those without coding experience.  Would be keen to learn more.\n- Gave an insight of advancement in tech that hopefully Procurement can use the same principle with products and logistics using the clinical model\n  \n:::  \n\n\n## Welcome\n\n-   welcome to **Why bother with Power BI?**\n-   this session is ðŸ¥¬ - a non-technical introduction for pre-beginners\n-   if you can't access the chat, you might need to join our Teams channel: **tinyurl.com/kindnetwork**\n\n## The KIND network\n\n-   a social learning space for staff working with **k**nowledge, **i**nformation, and **d**ata across health, social care, and housing in Scotland\n-   we offer social support, free training, mentoring, community events, ...\n-   [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3AQZ7-PbFVcziG2piHLt1_ifey3I2cwFL0yBuTSS8vVao1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=106d08f3-9026-40e2-b3c7-87cd87304d58&tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a) / [mailing list](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=veDvEDCgykuAnLXmdF5JmpopIZB9ynRJnrPUHVFccipURjM2NkZJUkhGOFlQRjQxRFhVUTgwT0UwVyQlQCN0PWcu)\n\n## Session outline\n\n-   two minute overview of Power BI\n-   strengths and weaknesses\n-   making Power BI work for you\n-   next steps and training\n\n## A brief overview of Power BI\n\n-   new\n-   integrates several existing Microsoft products (bits of Excel, PowerPivot, PowerQuery...)\n-   produces interactive dashboards\n-   proprietary, closed-source, paid-for\n\n## Central idea\n\n-   data is complicated\n-   good data analysis helps make services better\n-   but predicting what data users will need is hard\n\n## Why are users so fussy about their data?\n\n-   data can be used to answer lots of different kinds of questions\n    -   answering which/when questions\n    -   seeing effects of changes\n    -   comparing different areas\n    -   looking at services over time\n    -   ...\n\n## Power BI\n\n-   lets users re-arrange their data to suit (interactive)\n-   provides a standard way of accessing data from lots of sources ([data hub](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODMwNjRjMGMtZDhhZC00ZjQzLTgzYWItZTA3ZWM0ZDcyOGY2IiwidCI6IjUwZjYwNzFmLWJiZmUtNDAxYS04ODAzLTY3Mzc0OGU2MjllMiIsImMiOjh9))\n-   scales really well ([dashboard example](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODJjOGE3ZDUtM2ViNy00YjBlLTllMjktOTNjZjlkODJhODU4IiwidCI6ImU3YTEzYWVhLTk0MzctNGRiNy1hMjJiLWNmYWE0Y2UzM2I2ZSJ9))\n\n## Power BI demo\n\n### take [a spreadsheet](data/gp_pract.xlsx) and load that data </br>\n![](images/clipboard-1773606480.png) \n\n### preview the data </br>\n![](images/clipboard-3750020719.png)\n\n### work with the data in Power BI </br> \n![](images/clipboard-887422480.png)\n\n### tidy/wrangle the data in Power Query </br> \n![](images/clipboard-2135432491.png)\n### add a map visual </br> \n![](images/clipboard-4289264945.png)\n\n### populate with our data </br> \n![](images/clipboard-4285049290.png)\n\n### add a column graph </br> \n![](images/clipboard-4221248636.png)\n\n### populate with drag and drop </br> \n![](images/clipboard-1883827365.png)\n\n### add slicer </br> \n![](images/clipboard-1767130583.png) \n\n### slicers change our visualisations </br> \n![](images/clipboard-2628441850.png)\n\n### add a numeric summary </br> \n![](images/clipboard-3093070697.png)\n\n### publish\nSee [preview](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/3fef0f33-7d64-47b8-9e1c-ae0129db6720/ReportSection?experience=power-bi) - although note that access might require permission\n\n## Five top tips\n\n- potentially has the power to get lots of new good out of existing data\n- Power BI needs tidy input data - so use Excel tables etc\n- don't believe the no-code lies - you'll need some [DAX](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/) and [Power Query M](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/)\n- [publishing is complicated and potentially expensive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/pricing), so needs investigating before building a product\n- complex IG picture across Scotland, so please get official guidance early\n\n## Chat, queries, questions\n\n-   Teams channel: **tinyurl.com/kindnetwork**\n-   weekly email update: **tinyurl.com/kindupdate**\n-   Training mini-site: **tinyurl.com/kindtrain**\n",
