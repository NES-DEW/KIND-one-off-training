The answer is yes, if only NHS restrictions would allow us to use Power BI ðŸ˜‚\n  \n:::  \n\n\n\n\n## Welcome!\n\n-   this session is a **non-technical overview** designed for service leads\n- <i class=\"far fa-file-pdf\"></i>[pdf version of the session slides](\"data/scope_of_the_possible_with_power_bi.pdf\")\n\n## Session outline\n\n-   Why Power BI, and why this session?\n-   Power BI demo - build a simple dashboard\n-   Strengths and weaknesses\n    -   obvious\n    -   less obvious\n-   Alternatives\n-   Skill development\n\n## Power BI?\n\n-   new (c.2015)\n-   based on Microsoft's SQL reporting products\n    -   proprietary, closed-source, paid-for\n-   integrates functions from several other Microsoft data products (bits of Excel, PowerPivot, PowerQueryâ€¦)\n-   produces interactive dashboards\n\n## Why this session?\n\n-   there is a lot of fluff talked about Power BI\n    -   e.g. elaborate visualisations, fancy real-time data products...\n-   Power BI in general is promoted as a no-code tool\n    -   that's just not true, as we'll see\n-   Power BI has a sales-y focus\n    -   that conceals some of its most useful properties\n-   so Power BI, as a platform, requires some translation to the complicated reality of health and social care data\n    -   and Power BI offers real strengths in managing and exploiting our data, even when the pain-points are taken into account\n\n## Power BI demo\n\n-   using tidied of the [GP practice size dataset](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/gp-practice-contact-details-and-list-sizes) from April 2024\n    - [GP practice size data](\"data/apr_2024_clean.xlsx\")\n     - [Demographic data](\"data/3 - demographics.csv\")\n  \n\n\nTable: Note this data is cleaned\n\n|Name                            | PracticeListSize|Postcode |HBName                 |GPCluster              |  Code|\n|:-------------------------------|----------------:|:--------|:----------------------|:----------------------|-----:|\n|Dr Friel & Dr Bagnall           |             3741|G73 2PQ  |NHS Lanarkshire        |Rutherglen             | 60181|\n|Park Avenue Medical Centre      |             7952|FK8 2AU  |NHS Forth Valley       |Stirling City          | 25582|\n|Beith Health Centre GP Practice |             5702|KA15 2AE |NHS Ayrshire and Arran |Garnock Valley Cluster | 80147|\n\n\n\n## Load some data\n\n![Lots of different data loading options](images/clipboard-1095239384.png)\n\n## Preview\n\n![Friendly tools for previewing data](images/clipboard-570198799.png)\n\n## Add to a map\n\n![Clever use of commercial postcode data](images/clipboard-1608638999.png)\n\n## Add interactions\n\n![Visualisations are interactive](images/clipboard-1372596463.png)\n\n## Add more visuals\n\n![30-odd built in, hundreds of free additional visuals, thousands of (often dodgy) commercial add-ins](images/clipboard-2549253369.png)\n\n## Add more data\n\n![Totally different data, but harmonised process for loading](images/clipboard-2157605622.png)\n\n## Re-shape that data\n\n![Neatly-integrated PowerQuery, gives loads of scope for tidying and fixing data](images/clipboard-256142195.png)\n\n## Data modelling tools\n\n![Full suite of relational tools for the more ambitious projects](images/clipboard-1503081705.png)\n\n## Pre-packed visuals\n\n![Microsoft's Tornado chart](images/clipboard-3368145622.png)\n\n## Demographics\n\n![These can be cross filtered to give national/board/practice level insights](images/clipboard-3099396019.png)\n\n## Strengths\n\n-   by far the easiest way of producing interactive data products\n-   great tools for tidying data\n- good for iterative projects\n-   data hubbing / self-service data\n-   scaling\n-   potential to manage complex and sensitive data on existing infrastructure\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n-   really needs clean and tidy data\n-   publication can be complicated and expensive\n-   steepening pain curve. Easy to start projects, but more involved analysis is messy\n-   complex IG landscape\n-   messy skills development journey",
