Brendan explained everything really well.\n- Was interested in whether Power BI might be a useful way to provide access to our 'siloed' data to management.  The answer is yes, if only NHS restrictions would allow us to use Power BI ðŸ˜‚\n- Excellent session that removed the fear of giving Power BI a go\n  \n:::  \n:::\n\n\n\n## Session outline\n\n-   this session is a **non-technical overview** designed for service leads\n-   Why Power BI, and why this session?\n-   Power BI demo - build a simple dashboard\n-   Strengths and weaknesses\n    -   obvious\n    -   less obvious\n-   Alternatives\n-   Skill development\n\n## Power BI?\n\n-   newish (c.2015)\n-   based on Microsoft's SQL reporting products\n    -   proprietary, closed-source, paid-for\n-   integrates functions from several other Microsoft data products (bits of Excel, PowerPivot, PowerQueryâ€¦)\n-   produces interactive dashboards\n\n## Why this session?\n\n-   there is a lot of fluff talked about Power BI\n    -   e.g. elaborate visualisations, fancy real-time data products...\n-   Power BI in general is promoted as a no-code tool\n    -   that's just not true, as we'll see\n-   Power BI has a sales-y focus\n    -   that conceals some of its most useful properties\n-   so Power BI, as a platform, requires some translation to the complicated reality of health and social care data\n    -   and Power BI offers real strengths in managing and exploiting our data, even when the pain-points are taken into account\n\n## Power BI demo\n\n-   using tidied of the [GP practice size dataset](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/gp-practice-contact-details-and-list-sizes) from April 2024\n    -   [GP practice size data](%22data/apr_2024_clean.xlsx%22)\n    -   [Demographic data](%22data/3%20-%20demographics.csv%22)\n\n\n\n\nTable: Note this data is cleaned\n\n|Name                      | PracticeListSize|Postcode |HBName                    |GPCluster                  |  Code|\n|:-------------------------|----------------:|:--------|:-------------------------|:--------------------------|-----:|\n|Centenary Surgery         |             2457|ML5 4BY  |NHS Lanarkshire           |Coatbridge                 | 61216|\n|Glenluce Surgery          |             2170|DG8 0PU  |NHS Dumfries and Galloway |Wigtownshire               | 18589|\n|Shebburn Medical Practice |             2802|DG2 8BY  |NHS Dumfries and Galloway |Dumfries & Upper Nithsdale | 18254|\n\n\n\n## Load some data\n\n![Lots of different data loading options](images/clipboard-1095239384.png)\n\n## Preview\n\n![Friendly tools for previewing data](images/clipboard-570198799.png)\n\n## Add to a map\n\n![Clever use of commercial postcode data](images/clipboard-1608638999.png)\n\n## Add interactions\n\n![Visualisations are interactive](images/clipboard-1372596463.png)\n\n## Publish\n\n![](images/clipboard-3096192703.png)\n\n## Add more visuals\n\n![30-odd built in, hundreds of free additional visuals, thousands of (often dodgy) commercial add-ins](images/clipboard-2549253369.png)\n\n## Add more data\n\n-   we could add the [health board names](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/geography-codes-and-labels/resource/652ff726-e676-4a20-abda-435b98dd7bdc), to make our visual more useful\n-   we could also get [GP practice demographics](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/gp-practice-populations)\n\n## Add more data\n\n![Totally different data, but harmonised process for loading](images/clipboard-2157605622.png)\n\n## Re-shape that data\n\n![Neatly-integrated PowerQuery, gives loads of scope for tidying and fixing data](images/clipboard-256142195.png)\n\n## Data modelling tools\n\n![Full suite of relational tools for the more ambitious projects](images/clipboard-1503081705.png)\n\n## Pre-packed visuals\n\n![Microsoft's Tornado chart](images/clipboard-3368145622.png)\n\n## Demographics\n\n![These can be cross filtered to give national/board/practice level insights](images/clipboard-3099396019.png)\n\n## Strengths\n\n-   by far the easiest way of producing interactive data products\n-   great tools for tidying data\n-   good for iterative projects\n-   data hubbing / self-service data\n-   scaling\n-   potential to manage complex and sensitive data on existing infrastructure\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n-   really needs clean and tidy data\n-   publication can be complicated and expensive\n-   steepening pain curve. Easy to start projects, but more involved analysis is messy\n-   complex IG landscape\n-   messy skills development journey\n",
