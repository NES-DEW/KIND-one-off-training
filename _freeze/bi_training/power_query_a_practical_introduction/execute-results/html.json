Information in laymen's terms which is really helpful.  thank you\n- Really helpful to have a play in realtime, good way of taking in the practical use of the tools\n  \n:::  \n\n\n## Welcome\n\n-   ðŸŒ¶ this session is a beginner-level introduction to PowerQuery\n-   you'll either Excel desktop (\\>2007) or Power BI desktop\n-   you'll also need to have basic competency in Excel or Power BI\n-   this session is based on our [Power BI for Beginners](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/70921) course\n-   but PowerQuery isn't specific to Power BI - it's brilliant for Excel too\n\n## Session outline\n\n-   what is PowerQuery, and why might you use it?\n-   getting data into PowerQuery\n-   basic data wrangling\n-   joins (merges)\n-   pivots\n\n## What is PowerQuery?\n\n-   Microsoft call it a [\"data transformation and data preparation engine\"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/power-query-what-is-power-query)\n-   it's been around since 2010, initially in Excel, and then in both Excel and Power BI\n-   uses code ([M Formula language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Query)) but has GUI tools for most tasks\n\n## How I think of PowerQuery\n\n-   the right way to load any real data into Excel\n\n## Why might you use it?\n\n-   powerful\n-   easy, to start with at least...\n-   allows you to standardise data loading from different sources\n-   allows you to repeat data loading\n\n## Getting data into PowerQuery\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Excel\n\n1.  Open Excel and create a new, blank, workbook\n2.  `Data` \\> `Get & Transform Data` </br> ![Get & Transform Data](images/clipboard-2636372440.png)\n3.  Pick `From Web` and supply the following URL - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-07-25/scurvy.csv`\n4.  From the preview, select `Transform data` to open PowerQuery\n\n### Power BI\n\n1.  Open Power BI and start a new report\n2.  Select `Get data` \\> `From Web` button in the ribbon ![Get data from web](images/clipboard-2012149707.png){height=\"200\"}\n3.  Supply the following URL - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-07-25/scurvy.csv` </br>![supply a URL](images/clipboard-1484642386.png)\n4.  From the preview, select `Transform data` to open PowerQuery </br> ![Select Transform data to open PowerQuery](images/clipboard-4163607856.png)\n5.  If you've already got some data in your report that you'd like to transform, use `Tranform data` in the ribbon to open PowerQuery: </br> ![Tranform data in the ribbon](images/clipboard-1924567552.png)\n:::\n\n-   this is historical data about scurvy testing from the [medicaldata r package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/medicaldata/index.html)\n\n## Preview your Data\n\n![make sure to click Transform data](images/clipboard-2984247945.png) </br> (make sure to click `Transform data`)\n\n## First view of PowerQuery\n\n![First view of PowerQuery](images/clipboard-1738142120.png)\n\n-   Queries (= datasets) on the left\n-   ribbon menu at the top\n-   Query settings (= the changes you'll make to your data) on the right\n-   Excel-ish data preview in the middle\n\n## Basic data wrangling\n\n-   right click the `study_id` column and select `Remove`\n    -   the column will disappear\n    -   but you'll also gain a step in your Applied Steps field </br>![](images/clipboard-1788638263.png)\n-   you can edit this step\n    -   if you're code-confident, you can edit the formula to read `= Table.RemoveColumns(#\"Changed Type\",{\"study_id\", \"treatment\"})` to also remove the treatment column\n    -   and you can remove the step using the X next to the step name ![](images/clipboard-3939638955.png)\n-   you should also try renaming and reordering your columns in the same way\n-   once you've had a play, please remove the steps until you're left with the data you started with (so delete back to \"Changed Type\")\n\n## Replacing values\n\n-   we can also work with individual values\n-   our values are a number, then an underscore, then a word\n-   we can `Split column` at the underscore\n-   we could also replace the odd underscores in the treatment column\n\n## Reshaping data\n\n-   we could go column by column here splitting, but an easier approach would be to re-shape the data\n-   select the first three columns, and select `Unpivot Other Columns` </br>![](images/clipboard-1884864280.png)\n-   then split, change type, and generally tidy up\n\n## Add columns\n\nOur treatment and dosing columns are annoying. Let's make a new, joined, column for them:\n\n-   select `Custom Column`</br>![Custom Column](images/clipboard-1596515682.png)\n-   you can click the gearwheel next to the step if you'd like to go back and tweak\n\n## Close and load / Close and Apply sends your data back to Excel/Power BI\n\n![](images/clipboard-2525392040.png)\n\n## Getting more fancy: a bigger dataset\n\n-   please load the [Health and Care Experience survey results from 2023-4](https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/statistics/2024/05/health-and-care-experience-survey-2023-to-2024-results-by-geography/documents/health-and-care-experience-survey-2023-to-2024-geographical-data/health-and-care-experience-survey-2023-to-2024-geographical-data/govscot%3Adocument/Health%2Band%2BCare%2BExperience%2BSurvey%2B2023%2Bto%2B2024%2B-tables%2Bof%2Bresults%2Bby%2Bgeography.xlsx)</br> ![](images/clipboard-738553132.png)\n-   or [alternative local version](https://github.com/NES-DEW/KIND-training/raw/main/excel/src/HACE_2023-4.xlsx)\n-   please load both the proper datasets (and ignore the background)</br> ![Load both the proper datasets](images/clipboard-4050914485.png){height=\"200\"}\n\n## A challenge\n\nCan you find the number of responses to each question for your local NHS board? You should be able to re-work this data to give something like: ![](images/clipboard-3334683078.png)\n\n### Some hints\n\n-   filtering works like Excel, but is destructive\n-   unpivoting, doing something to all the rows, then re-pivoting is a great way to work across lots of columns\n-   you can join structurally similar datasets using `Append Queries as New`</br>![Append Queries as New](images/clipboard-3061387544.png)\n-   you can deduplicate entire datasets by selecting all the columns and using `Remove Rows` \\> `Remove Duplicates`\n",
