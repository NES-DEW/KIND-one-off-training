There‚Äôs a large (and growing) workforce responsible for this work in Scotland. However, this workforce is really diverse. It‚Äôs not like e.g.¬†nursing or other NMHAP professions where there are fixed entry and promotion criteria. Professional development is more complicated and messy than that. A good example is the lack of standardised job titles for KIND workers. We currently have something like 350 different job titles in the Teams channel. That splitting up of job families contributes to KIND workers being less visible than I think they should be. Kathleen Grey and colleagues called them ‚Äúghosts in the machine‚Äù"

    "text": "The basic recipe here is:\n\nread our Excel spreadsheets into R\ntry some simple base-R methods of comparison\nget more fancy with packages for more useful comparisons\n\n\n\nThis can be messy. readxl is probably the most straightforward place to start. Make sure a) that your Excel files aren‚Äôt open in Excel when you try to read them and b) that you‚Äôre happy and confident that your data is on the first worksheet (or you know the correct name of the sheet). You‚Äôll almost certainly want to be working in an R project too to avoid too much messing around with file paths, getwd(), etc.\n\nlibrary(readxl) # to attach the readxl package\nb1 &lt;- read_xlsx(\"data/Book1.xlsx\") \nb2 &lt;- read_xlsx(\"data/Book2.xlsx\") # to read the files\n\n\n\n\nThe most obvious thing to try first is a check for equality. You‚Äôll do this with a double equal sign, like this:\n\nb1 == b2\n\n      name score\n [1,] TRUE  TRUE\n [2,] TRUE  TRUE\n [3,] TRUE  TRUE\n [4,] TRUE  TRUE\n [5,] TRUE  TRUE\n [6,] TRUE  TRUE\n [7,] TRUE  TRUE\n [8,] TRUE  TRUE\n [9,] TRUE  TRUE\n[10,] TRUE  TRUE\n\n\n(single = is effectively the same as &lt;-)\nThat gives us back quite a complicated matrix of results, showing a cell-by-cell comparison of the two sets of data. This happens because R is vectorised - so when we compare two identically-shaped bits of data, R will assume that we want to do our comparison to each of the items in turn. If we just looked at the number values in our spreadsheets, which we could do by using the $ to refer to a column, we could:\n\nb1$score - b2$score\n\n [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nWhich I suppose is another way of checking for equality. So could also use a helper function to collapse all of those down into one:\n\nsum(b1$score - b2$score)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nIf we just wanted a simple true/false measure for the data as a whole, we could recruit the very useful all() and any():\n\nall(b1 == b2) # to check all values are the same\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nany(b1 == b2) # to check any values are the same\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nYou could do something very similar using setequal():\n\nsetequal(b1, b2)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\nwaldo::compare() is a brilliant way of comparing complex data:\n\nwaldo::compare(b1, b2)\n\n‚úî No differences\n\n\nIf we vandalise one of our datasets by changing one value, waldo does plenty of useful work to bring the correct parts of the data to our attention:\n\nb2[5,2] &lt;- 1\nwaldo::compare(b1, b2)\n\nold vs new\n                score\n  old[2, ]  0.2481382\n  old[3, ]  0.6444191\n  old[4, ]  0.8873743\n- old[5, ]  0.3361401\n+ new[5, ]  1.0000000\n  old[6, ]  0.1597596\n  old[7, ]  0.3928778\n  old[8, ]  0.5743370\n\n`old$score[2:8]`: 0.2 0.6 0.9 0.3 0.2 0.4 0.6\n`new$score[2:8]`: 0.2 0.6 0.9 1.0 0.2 0.4 0.6\n\n\nI suppose we could also graph our data to show changed points.

    "text": "The basic recipe here is:\n\nread our Excel spreadsheets into R\ntry some simple base-R methods of comparison\nget more fancy with packages for more useful comparisons\n\n\n\nThis can be messy. readxl is probably the most straightforward place to start. Make sure a) that your Excel files aren‚Äôt open in Excel when you try to read them and b) that you‚Äôre happy and confident that your data is on the first worksheet (or you know the correct name of the sheet). You‚Äôll almost certainly want to be working in an R project too to avoid too much messing around with file paths, getwd(), etc.\n\nlibrary(readxl) # to attach the readxl package\nb1 &lt;- read_xlsx(\"data/Book1.xlsx\") \nb2 &lt;- read_xlsx(\"data/Book2.xlsx\") # to read the files\n\n\n\n\nThe most obvious thing to try first is a check for equality. You‚Äôll do this with a double equal sign, like this:\n\nb1 == b2\n\n      name score\n [1,] TRUE  TRUE\n [2,] TRUE  TRUE\n [3,] TRUE  TRUE\n [4,] TRUE  TRUE\n [5,] TRUE  TRUE\n [6,] TRUE  TRUE\n [7,] TRUE  TRUE\n [8,] TRUE  TRUE\n [9,] TRUE  TRUE\n[10,] TRUE  TRUE\n\n\n(single = is effectively the same as &lt;-)\nThat gives us back quite a complicated matrix of results, showing a cell-by-cell comparison of the two sets of data. This happens because R is vectorised - so when we compare two identically-shaped bits of data, R will assume that we want to do our comparison to each of the items in turn.

    "text": "How to think about joins?\nWe did a simple join above. A join is a way of merging two datasets. Let‚Äôs demonstrate with some cut-down datasets from above. We‚Äôll remove some of the values from our b1 set and from our b2 set:\n\nb1 &lt;- b1 |&gt;\n  slice(1:5)\n\nb1\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 2\n  name     score\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 kennedy  0.590\n2 victoria 0.248\n3 peter    0.644\n4 judi     0.887\n5 paul     0.336\n\n\n\nb2 &lt;- b2 |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n = 5)\n\nb2\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 2\n  name     score\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 peter    0.644\n2 linsey   0.971\n3 paul     1    \n4 jennifer 0.160\n5 kenneth  0.393\n\n\nThe simplest join we could do is to bind the rows from one set onto another:\n\nb1 |&gt;\n  bind_rows(b2)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 2\n   name     score\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 kennedy  0.590\n 2 victoria 0.248\n 3 peter    0.644\n 4 judi     0.887\n 5 paul     0.336\n 6 peter    0.644\n 7 linsey   0.971\n 8 paul     1    \n 9 jennifer 0.160\n10 kenneth  0.393\n\n\nThat just brings all the rows from b2 onto the end of b1. Unlike binding, though, in a join we usually want to only include some of our values. So let‚Äôs now left-join b2:\n\nb1 |&gt;\n  left_join(b2, by = \"name\")\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 3\n  name     score.x score.y\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 kennedy    0.590  NA    \n2 victoria   0.248  NA    \n3 peter      0.644   0.644\n4 judi       0.887  NA    \n5 paul       0.336   1    \n\n\nYou should see that only the values from b2‚Äôs score column that have a corresponding name in b1 get populated, and everything else gets filled with NAs. Here‚Äôs a nice introduction to the different kinds of join you can do in dplyr."
