Regex, as the wikipedia page suggests, have been around for ages - positively archaeological in computing terms. So for the book of the week this week, I wanted to show off one of the most interesting bits of social history I've read: Tom Lean's Electronic Dreams. Lots of the history of computing is either primarily about the technical details, or is a broadly nostalgic look at obsolete tech. This book doesn't do either of those, instead spending its time giving a concise account of how personal computing worked as a social phenomenon. For example, how did people start getting paid to write computer games? What happened when the BBC got involved in personal computing? What happened to the various promises of digital revolutions as a replacement for manufacturing industries.\"\n\nbotw[5,] |&gt;\n  select(Author, Year) # subsetting by index and columns and returning a tibble\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Author   Year \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 Tom Lean 2016 \n\nbotw |&gt;\n  filter(Year &gt; 2010) |&gt;\n  arrange(Year) # subsetting by filtering years, then sorting using dplyr\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 8\n  Date       Author    Year  Title    ISBN Worldcat KnowledgeNetwork Description\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;      \n1 13/03/2024 Kevin Mi… 2011  Ghos… 9.78e12 https:/… &lt;NA&gt;             \"Here's a …\n2 12/06/2024 Naomi Or… 2012  Merc… 9.78e12 https:/… https://nhs.pri… \"While the…\n3 27/03/2024 Katrine … 2016  Who … 9.78e12 https:/… &lt;NA&gt;              &lt;NA&gt;      \n4 24/04/2024 Tom Lean  2016  Elec… 9.78e12 https:/… &lt;NA&gt;             \"We're loo…\n5 22/05/2024 John Car… 2018  Bad … 9.78e12 https:/… &lt;NA&gt;             \"A love-le…\n6 03/07/2024 Lisa Fel… 2018  How … 9.78e12 https:/… https://nhs.pri… \"This week…\n7 01/05/2024 Caroline… 2019  Invi… 9.78e12 https:/… &lt;NA&gt;             \"Anyone wh…\n\nbotw[which(botw$Author %in% c(\"Katrine Marçal\", \"Caroline Criado Perez\")),] # finding matching values using base R\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 8\n  Date       Author    Year  Title    ISBN Worldcat KnowledgeNetwork Description\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;      \n1 27/03/2024 Katrine … 2016  Who … 9.78e12 https:/… &lt;NA&gt;             &lt;NA&gt;       \n2 01/05/2024 Caroline… 2019  Invi… 9.78e12 https:/… &lt;NA&gt;             Anyone who…\n\nbotw |&gt;\n  tidyr::drop_na() # removes any missing values in the whole tibble\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 8\n  Date       Author    Year  Title    ISBN Worldcat KnowledgeNetwork Description\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;      \n1 12/06/2024 Naomi Or… 2012  Merc… 9.78e12 https:/… https://nhs.pri… While the …\n2 03/07/2024 Lisa Fel… 2018  How … 9.78e12 https:/… https://nhs.pri… This week'…\n3 10/07/2024 Aviva Pe… 2000  Medi… 9.78e12 https:/… https://nhs.pri… There are …\n\nbotw$Title |&gt;\n  tolower() # returning the title column as a lower-case vector\n\n [1] \"the code book\"                                                                      \n [2] \"ghost in the wires\"                                                                 \n [3] \"the arch of knowledge\"                                                              \n [4] \"who cooked adam smith's dinner\"                                                     \n [5] \"electronic dreams: how 1980s britain learned to love the computer\"                  \n [6] \"invisible women: exposing data bias in a world designed for men\"                    \n [7] \"the mismeasure of man (2nd ed)\"                                                     \n [8] \"being wrong: adventures in the margin of error\"                                     \n [9] \"bad blood: secrets and lies in a silicon valley startup\"                            \n[10] \"genesis and development of a scientific fact\"                                       \n[11] \"in the beginning was the worm : finding the secrets of life in a tiny hermaphrodite\"\n[12] \"merchants of doubt\"                                                                 \n[13] \"harvey's heart: the discovery of blood circulation\"                                 \n[14] \"dark remedy: the impact of thalidomide and its revival as a vital medicine\"         \n[15] \"how emotions are made\"                                                              \n[16] \"medical statistics at a glance\"                                                     \n\nbotw |&gt;\n  mutate(Date = lubridate::dmy(Date)) |&gt; # fixing publication dates\n  group_by(month = lubridate::floor_date(Date, unit = \"month\")) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean_year = mean(as.numeric(Year), na.rm = T)) # average year of publication by month of botw\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  month      mean_year\n  &lt;date&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2024-03-01     2003 \n2 2024-04-01     2016 \n3 2024-05-01     2011.\n4 2024-06-01     2004.\n5 2024-07-01     2009"

There’s a large (and growing) workforce responsible for this work in Scotland. However, this workforce is really diverse. It’s not like e.g. nursing or other NMHAP professions where there are fixed entry and promotion criteria. Professional development is more complicated and messy than that. A good example is the lack of standardised job titles for KIND workers. We currently have something like 350 different job titles in the Teams channel. That splitting up of job families contributes to KIND workers being less visible than I think they should be. Kathleen Grey and colleagues called them “ghosts in the machine”"

    "text": "How to think about joins?\nWe did a simple join above. A join is a way of merging two datasets. Let’s demonstrate with some cut-down datasets from above. We’ll remove some of the values from our b1 set and from our b2 set:\n\nb1 &lt;- b1 |&gt;\n  slice(1:5)\n\nb1\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  name     score\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 kennedy  0.590\n2 victoria 0.248\n3 peter    0.644\n4 judi     0.887\n5 paul     0.336\n\n\n\nb2 &lt;- b2 |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n = 5)\n\nb2\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  name    score\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 paul    1    \n2 alupha  0.574\n3 michael 0.561\n4 kenneth 0.393\n5 judi    0.887\n\n\nThe simplest join we could do is to bind the rows from one set onto another:\n\nb1 |&gt;\n  bind_rows(b2)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   name     score\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 kennedy  0.590\n 2 victoria 0.248\n 3 peter    0.644\n 4 judi     0.887\n 5 paul     0.336\n 6 paul     1    \n 7 alupha   0.574\n 8 michael  0.561\n 9 kenneth  0.393\n10 judi     0.887\n\n\nThat just brings all the rows from b2 onto the end of b1. Unlike binding, though, in a join we usually want to only include some of our values. So let’s now left-join b2:\n\nb1 |&gt;\n  left_join(b2, by = \"name\")\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  name     score.x score.y\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 kennedy    0.590  NA    \n2 victoria   0.248  NA    \n3 peter      0.644  NA    \n4 judi       0.887   0.887\n5 paul       0.336   1    \n\n\nYou should see that only the values from b2’s score column that have a corresponding name in b1 get populated, and everything else gets filled with NAs. Here’s a nice introduction to the different kinds of join you can do in dplyr."

    "title": "Parameterised Rmarkdown",
    "section": "Ways of knitting",
    "text": "Ways of knitting\nWe’ll need to start with a hello-world Rmarkdown document. That should be knit-able from the knit button . But you should also be able to knit using rmarkdown::render() to produce some output. Together, those three elements look like this:\n\nRmarkdownRender codeOutput\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Plain Rmarkdown\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n\n```{r, results='asis'}\ncat(\"Hello world\")\n```\n\n\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"01_rmd.Rmd\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gets more interesting when you start specifying options inside render. A basic example of this would be to change the output filename by adding output_file:\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"Rmarkdown.Rmd\", \n                  output_file = \"Rmarkdown_plain.html\")\n\nWe could also change our output format. By default, rmarkdown docs get rendered to whatever is specified in the header. That’s HTML in our case, but we could fiddle that to give us .pdf output:\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"Rmarkdown.Rmd\", \n                  output_file = \"Rmarkdown_plain.pdf\",\n                  output_format = pdf_document)\n\nNote that we’re still producing the same output each time, albeit with different filenames and in different formats. The next part is to add params, which will enable us to change the content. We need to make two changes to our Rmd first:\n\nRmarkdownRender codeOutput\n\n\nWe add params in the header, and some code (params$name) to access their values in the body of our Rmarkdown document:\n---\ntitle: \"Rmarkdown with params\"\noutput: html_document\nparams:\n  name: \"Bruce\" # added a param with a default value\n---\n\n```{r, results='asis'}\ncat(paste(\"Hello\", params$name)) # use that param in the body of the document\n```\n\n\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"02_rmd.Rmd\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now add some params in our render code to produce a different output. Note that, as we set defaults in the Rmarkdown header, these params are optional. But if we do include params in our render call, they will over-ride the defaults:\n\nRmarkdownRender codeOutput\n\n\nSame Rmarkdown:\n---\ntitle: \"Rmarkdown with params\"\noutput: html_document\nparams:\n  name: \"Bruce\" # added a param with a default value\n---\n\n```{r, results='asis'}\ncat(paste(\"Hello\", params$name)) # use that param in the body of the document\n```\n\n\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"02_rmd.Rmd\",\n                  params = list(name = \"Steve\")) # new param"
