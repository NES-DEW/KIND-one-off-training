    "section": "How to think about joins?",
    "text": "How to think about joins?\nWe did a simple join above. A join is a way of merging two datasets. Let’s demonstrate with some cut-down datasets from above. We’ll remove some of the values from our b1 set and from our b2 set:\n\nb1 &lt;- b1 |&gt;\n  slice(1:5)\n\nb1\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  name     score\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 kennedy  0.590\n2 victoria 0.248\n3 peter    0.644\n4 judi     0.887\n5 paul     0.336\n\n\n\nb2 &lt;- b2 |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n = 5)\n\nb2\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  name     score\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 kenneth  0.393\n2 judi     0.887\n3 peter    0.644\n4 jennifer 0.160\n5 linsey   0.971\n\n\nThe simplest join we could do is to bind the rows from one set onto another:\n\nb1 |&gt;\n  bind_rows(b2)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   name     score\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 kennedy  0.590\n 2 victoria 0.248\n 3 peter    0.644\n 4 judi     0.887\n 5 paul     0.336\n 6 kenneth  0.393\n 7 judi     0.887\n 8 peter    0.644\n 9 jennifer 0.160\n10 linsey   0.971\n\n\nThat just brings all the rows from b2 onto the end of b1. Unlike binding, though, in a join we usually want to only include some of our values. So let’s now left-join b2:\n\nb1 |&gt;\n  left_join(b2, by = \"name\")\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  name     score.x score.y\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 kennedy    0.590  NA    \n2 victoria   0.248  NA    \n3 peter      0.644   0.644\n4 judi       0.887   0.887\n5 paul       0.336  NA    \n\n\nYou should see that only the values from b2’s score column that have a corresponding name in b1 get populated, and everything else gets filled with NAs. Here’s a nice introduction to the different kinds of join you can do in dplyr."

There’s a large (and growing) workforce responsible for this work in Scotland. However, this workforce is really diverse. It’s not like e.g. nursing or other NMHAP professions where there are fixed entry and promotion criteria. Professional development is more complicated and messy than that. A good example is the lack of standardised job titles for KIND workers. We currently have something like 350 different job titles in the Teams channel. That splitting up of job families contributes to KIND workers being less visible than I think they should be. Kathleen Grey and colleagues called them “ghosts in the machine”"
