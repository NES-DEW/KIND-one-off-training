Regex, as the wikipedia page suggests, have been around for ages - positively archaeological in computing terms. So for the book of the week this week, I wanted to show off one of the most interesting bits of social history I've read: Tom Lean's Electronic Dreams. Lots of the history of computing is either primarily about the technical details, or is a broadly nostalgic look at obsolete tech. This book doesn't do either of those, instead spending its time giving a concise account of how personal computing worked as a social phenomenon. For example, how did people start getting paid to write computer games? What happened when the BBC got involved in personal computing? What happened to the various promises of digital revolutions as a replacement for manufacturing industries.\"\n\nbotw[5,] |&gt;\n  select(Author, Year) # subsetting by index and columns and returning a tibble\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Author   Year \n  &lt;chr&gt;

But you should also be able to knit using rmarkdown::render() to produce some output. Together, those three elements look like this:\n\nRmarkdownRender codeOutput\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Plain Rmarkdown\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n\n```{r, results='asis'}\ncat(\"Hello world\")\n```\n\n\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"01_rmd.Rmd\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gets more interesting when you start specifying options inside render. A basic example of this would be to change the output filename by adding output_file:\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"Rmarkdown.Rmd\", \n                  output_file = \"Rmarkdown_plain.html\")\n\nWe could also change our output format. By default, rmarkdown docs get rendered to whatever is specified in the header. That’s HTML in our case, but we could fiddle that to give us .pdf output:\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"Rmarkdown.Rmd\", \n                  output_file = \"Rmarkdown_plain.pdf\",\n                  output_format = pdf_document)\n\nNote that we’re still producing the same output each time, albeit with different filenames and in different formats. The next part is to add params, which will enable us to change the content. We need to make two changes to our Rmd first:\n\nRmarkdownRender codeOutput\n\n\nWe add params in the header, and some code (params$name) to access their values in the body of our Rmarkdown document:\n---\ntitle: \"Rmarkdown with params\"\noutput: html_document\nparams:\n  name: \"Bruce\" # added a param with a default value\n---\n\n```{r, results='asis'}\ncat(paste(\"Hello\", params$name)) # use that param in the body of the document\n```\n\n\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"02_rmd.Rmd\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now add some params in our render code to produce a different output. Note that, as we set defaults in the Rmarkdown header, these params are optional. But if we do include params in our render call, they will over-ride the defaults:\n\nRmarkdownRender codeOutput\n\n\nSame Rmarkdown:\n---\ntitle: \"Rmarkdown with params\"\noutput: html_document\nparams:\n  name: \"Bruce\" # added a param with a default value\n---\n\n```{r, results='asis'}\ncat(paste(\"Hello\", params$name)) # use that param in the body of the document\n```\n\n\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"02_rmd.Rmd\",\n                  params = list(name = \"Steve\")) # new param"

There’s a large (and growing) workforce responsible for this work in Scotland. However, this workforce is really diverse. It’s not like e.g. nursing or other NMHAP professions where there are fixed entry and promotion criteria. Professional development is more complicated and messy than that. A good example is the lack of standardised job titles for KIND workers. We currently have something like 350 different job titles in the Teams channel. That splitting up of job families contributes to KIND workers being less visible than I think they should be. Kathleen Grey and colleagues called them “ghosts in the machine”"
