All our courses are free to access.\nWe provide a social learning space in the Teams channel, with a range of events aimed at different aspects of this area of work. For example, we run a weekly topic-based community meetup session and a mentoring scheme.\nWe work with key national stakeholders to support and champion these training and learning activities. For example, we are currently developing resources to support analysts transitioning to R.\n\nAll these activities are responsive to your needs.

    "text": "Why does the KIND network exist?\nThis network exists to support people who work with knowledge, information, and data as they work to transform health and social care. There’s a large (and growing) workforce responsible for this work in Scotland. However, this workforce is really diverse. It’s not like e.g. nursing or other NMHAP professions where there are fixed entry and promotion criteria. Professional development is more complicated and messy than that. A good example is the lack of standardised job titles for KIND workers. We currently have something like 350 different job titles in the Teams channel. That splitting up of job families contributes to KIND workers being less visible than I think they should be. Kathleen Grey and colleagues called them “ghosts in the machine”"
