This is a set of training materials supporting the KIND network's series of one-off training sessions.

## How to use these materials

+ these pages contain the materials for the range of one-off training sessions provided by NHS Education for Scotland's KIND learning network
+ all our sessions are designed to be delivered live on Teams
+ all these materials are creative-commons licenced, so please feel free to reuse within those conditions
+ these sessions are periodically re-run, <a href="mailto:brendan.clarke2@nhs.scot">so please get in touch</a> if you'd find it helpful to have one or more sessions re-offered

## Thanks

These materials owe a huge debt to the many members of the KIND community who have contributed. More specifically, these pages are based on [Melissa Van Bussell's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arzBRW5XIkg) describing, with absolute clarity, how to deploy Quarto websites to GitHub pages.
